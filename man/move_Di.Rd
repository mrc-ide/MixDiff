  curr_aug_dat,

\arguments{
\item{i}{The index of the individual(s) for whom augmented data should be moved}

\item{group_idx}{The index of the group for whom augmented data should be moved}

\item{date_idx}{The index of the date which should be moved}

\item{curr_aug_dat}{The current augmented data; a list of observed data, in the format returned by \code{\link{simul_true_data}}.}

\item{theta}{List of parameters; see details.}

\item{obs_dat}{A list of observed data, in the format of the first element (called \code{obs_dat}) in the list returned by \code{\link{simul_obs_dat}}.}

\item{hyperparameters}{A list of hyperparameters: see details.}

\item{index_dates}{A list containing indications on which delays to consider in the estimation, see details.}

\item{range_dates}{A vector containing the range of dates in \code{obs_dat}. If NULL, will be computed automatically.}
}
\value{
A list of two elements:
 \itemize{
 \item{\code{new_aug_dat}}{: Same as \code{curr_aug_dat} but where the relevant dates have been updated}
 \item{\code{accept}}{: A scalar with value 1 if the move was accepted and 0 otherwise}
}
}
\description{
Performs one iteration of an MCMC move for the augmented data
}
\details{
\code{theta} should be a list containing:
\itemize{
 \item{\code{mu}}{: A list of length \code{n_groups} (the number of groups to be simulated data). Each element of \code{mu} should be a scalar of vector giving the mean delay(s) to use for simulation of dates in that group.}
 \item{\code{CV}}{: A list of length \code{n_groups}. Each element of \code{CV} should be a scalar of vector giving the coefficient o variation of the delay(s) to use for simulation of dates in that group.}
 \item{\code{zeta}}{: A scalar in [0;1] giving the probability that, if a data point is not missing, it is recorded with error.}
}
\code{hyperparameters} should be a list containing:
\itemize{
 \item{\code{shape1_prob_error}}{: A scalar giving the first shape parameter for the beta prior used for parameter \code{theta$zeta}}
 \item{\code{shape2_prob_error}}{: A scalar giving the second shape parameter for the beta prior used for parameter \code{theta$zeta}}
 \item{\code{mean_mean_delay}}{: A scalar giving the mean of the exponential prior used for parameter \code{theta$mu}}
 \item{\code{mean_CV_delay}}{: A scalar giving the mean of the exponential prior used for parameter \code{theta$CV}}
}
\code{index_dates} should be a list of length \code{n_groups=length(obs_dat)}. Each element of \code{index_dates} should be a matrix with 2 rows and a number of columns corresponding to the delays of interest for that group. For each column (i.e. each delay), the first row gives the index of the origin date, and the second row gives the index of the destination date.
The number of columns of index_dates[[k]] should match the length of theta$mu[[k]] and theta$CV[[k]]

If index_dates[[k]] has two columns containing respectively c(1, 2) and c(1, 3), this indicates that theta$mu[[k]] and theta$CV[[k]] are respectively the mean and coefficient of variation of two delays: the first delay being between date 1 and date 2, and the second being between date 1 and date 3.

The function performs the move as follows, using a Metropolis algorithm.
For the date to be moved, a new value is drawn from the marginal posterior of one of the delays this date is involved in.
If the date is involved in several delays, one of the delays is randomly selected.
The element E indicating whether the observed date is missing, recorded correctly or recorded with error, is adjusted accordingly given the proposed value of D.
The new augmented data is then accepted with probability given by the ratio of the posterior values at the new augmented data and the old augmented data.
